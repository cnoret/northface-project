54,"Highwater pfd vest - The constant boat angling dilemma: You know you should wear one, but who wants to fish all day in a life vest? Here's the solution: The Highwater Vest is a full-on USCG-approved Type III personal floatation device that's also a trim-fitting, functional fishing vest. Better yet, it's so comfortable and allows such a wide range of motion, you'll forget you're even wearing a PFD. The Highwater features Gaia foam that's lighter than conventional foam and free of CFC-ozone-depleting materials, without sacrificing performance. Deft adjustment points, die-cut/hand-skived foam and an open-mesh back keep the profile slim (and cool and comfortable to wear, even in a high-backed kayak seat or float tube). The low neckline, narrow chest and short waist create large armholes for unimpeded casting.
